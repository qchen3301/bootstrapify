This is the proof-of-concept page recoded to match HTML5 standards, with up-to-date (as of mid 2018) CSS encoding and the Bootstrap framework/library.

A lifetime ago I tried to teach myself front-end web design (in Dreamweaver no less! With *FLASH* oh lawd) This repo hosts the original proof of concept page and its relevant assets. A branch has been created that demonstrates the new, updated version using Bootstrap, with a bit more functionality. 

Not too much though, let's not shoot for the moon here...
